Workflow Overview
The project automates root cause analysis for application errors by combining log analysis with source code examination and AI-powered insights.

Step-by-Step Process:
Extract Log Data (ExtractLog.py)

Reads error logs from log folder (JSON format)
Extracts key information:
Timestamp, severity level, error message
Stack trace details
Source class that caused the error
Service and index information
Extract Source Code (ExtractSourceCode.py)

Takes the source class name from the log
Matches it to a corresponding Groovy file in src
Loads the actual source code that generated the error
Generate RCA via LLM (CallLLM.py)

Sends three pieces of context to Google's Gemini AI:
The error message
Stack trace analysis
Relevant source code
The AI generates:
Root Cause Analysis: Detailed explanation of what went wrong
Recommended Code Fix: Suggested code changes to prevent the issue
Save Results (WorkflowRCA.py)

Orchestrates the entire workflow using LangGraph
Saves two output files in RCAoutput folder:
.txt file with the AI-generated RCA and fix recommendations
_state.json file with complete debugging information (all intermediate data)
